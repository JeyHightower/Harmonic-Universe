# Harmonic Universe Verification Script Improvements

## Summary of Changes

The feature verification script has been significantly improved to better handle various API implementations and provide more detailed error reporting. The key improvements are:

1. **Enhanced API Endpoint Flexibility**:

   - Added support for alternative API endpoint paths
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for each test
   - Added handling for different response formats
   - Improved health check to try multiple endpoint patterns

2. **Better Error Handling and Reporting**:

   - Added detailed error information in the HTML report
   - Improved error message formatting and display
   - Added request/response details to error reports
   - Enhanced test summary with actionable recommendations

3. **Improved Mock Mode**:
   - Added more realistic mock responses
   - Enhanced mock response handling for edge cases
   - Made mock mode tests more robust and representative

## API Implementation Recommendations

Based on the verification tests, here are key recommendations for implementing or updating your API:

### Authentication Endpoints

- Standard endpoint paths: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/refresh`
- User profile endpoints: `/api/users/me` or `/api/user/profile`

### Universe Management Endpoints

- Universe CRUD operations: `/api/universes/`
- Universe physics: `/api/universes/{id}/physics`
- Scene reordering: `/api/scenes/reorder` or `/api/universes/{id}/reorder-scenes`

### Scene Management Endpoints

- Scene CRUD operations: `/api/scenes/`
- Scene listing: `/api/scenes/?universe_id={id}`

### Physics Parameters Endpoints

- Physics parameters CRUD: `/api/physics-parameters/`
- Universe-specific parameters: `/api/physics-parameters/universe/{id}`

### Audio Generation Endpoints

- Generate audio: `/api/audio/generate`
- Audio file retrieval: `/api/audio/{id}/file` or `/api/audio/file/{id}`
- Audio tracks listing: `/api/audio/tracks`

## Using the Verification Script

### Basic Usage

```
# Run against actual API
python feature_verification.py --base-url "http://localhost:8000"

# Run in mock mode
python feature_verification.py --mock-mode
```

### Addressing Common Issues

1. **404 Not Found Errors**: Check that your API endpoint paths match the expected patterns in the script. The script now tries multiple path formats, but your API should follow RESTful conventions.

2. **500 Server Errors**: These often indicate implementation issues in your API handlers. Check your error logs and ensure proper error handling.

3. **Response Format Mismatches**: Ensure your API responses follow consistent formats. Key fields the script expects include:

   - User info in authentication responses
   - IDs for created resources
   - Standard success responses for operations

4. **Missing Handlers**: If the verification shows missing endpoints, implement them according to the expectations in the verification script or update the script to match your implementation.

## Using Mock Mode as a Reference

The mock mode provides a reference implementation that shows:

- Expected API endpoint paths
- Required response formats
- Proper error handling patterns

You can run the script in mock mode to see what successful tests look like, then implement your actual API to match this behavior.

## Next Steps

1. Implement any missing API endpoints highlighted by the verification tests
2. Update existing endpoints to match expected formats and behaviors
3. Add comprehensive error handling to your API implementations
4. Once backend verification passes, implement frontend tests using browser automation tools
