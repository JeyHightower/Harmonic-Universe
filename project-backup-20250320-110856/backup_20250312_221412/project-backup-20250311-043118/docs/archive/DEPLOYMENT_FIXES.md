# Harmonic Universe Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **AttributeError: module 'app.wsgi' has no attribute 'application'**

   - Added `application = app` in app/wsgi.py to create the alias Gunicorn expects
   - Updated render_start.sh to use `app.wsgi:application` instead of `app.wsgi:app`

2. **404 Error on Root Route**

   - Added explicit root route handler in app/wsgi.py
   - Updated app/**init**.py with robust static file handling
   - Added fallback HTML generation if index.html is missing
   - Added better error handling and logging

3. **Static File Handling**

   - Ensured creation of all necessary static directories
   - Added inline generation of index.html if it doesn't exist
   - Improved symlink handling between static directories
   - Added detailed logging of static file operations

4. **Debugging and Diagnostics**
   - Added /debug endpoint to display application information
   - Added detailed logging throughout the application
   - Added directory content inspection in setup_render.py
   - Enhanced render_start.sh with diagnostic information

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. Check the /api/health endpoint:

   ```
   curl https://harmonic-universe.onrender.com/api/health
   ```

2. Visit the root route:

   ```
   https://harmonic-universe.onrender.com/
   ```

3. Check the debug endpoint:

   ```
   https://harmonic-universe.onrender.com/debug
   ```

4. Verify application logs in the Render.com dashboard for detailed diagnostic information.

## Ongoing Maintenance

- Monitor the application logs for any issues
- Check for static file serving problems
- Use the /debug endpoint for diagnostics
- Run the setup script locally to test changes before deployment
