# Harmonic Universe Feature Verification Reports

This directory contains HTML reports generated by the feature verification script for the Harmonic Universe project.

## Report Format

Each report is a standalone HTML file with the following naming convention:

```
test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html
```

Where `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` is the timestamp when the report was generated.

## Viewing Reports

To view a report, simply open the HTML file in your web browser. The reports are self-contained and do not require any additional resources.

## Running the Verification Script

To generate a new verification report, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
./verify_features.sh
```

This will:

1. Test all backend API endpoints
2. Perform basic frontend page checks
3. Generate a new HTML report
4. Open the report in your default web browser

## Report Features

The HTML reports include:

- A summary of all tests (passed, failed, skipped)
- Detailed results grouped by feature
- Error messages for failed tests
- Test execution timestamps
- Total execution time

## Keeping a History

Reports are timestamped and kept in this directory to maintain a history of verification runs. This allows tracking progress over time as features are implemented and issues are fixed.
