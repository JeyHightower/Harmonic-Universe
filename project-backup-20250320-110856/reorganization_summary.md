# Harmonic Universe Project Reorganization Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. Created a clean three-directory structure:
   - Root directory
   - Backend directory with Flask-SQLAlchemy
   - Frontend directory with React/Redux

2. Set up backend models:
   - Universe model
   - Scene model
   - PhysicsObject model
   - PhysicsParameter model
   - User model

3. Set up API routes for CRUD operations:
   - Universe routes
   - Scene routes
   - Physics Objects routes
   - Physics Parameters routes

4. Set up frontend structure:
   - React components
   - Redux store and slices
   - Feature components for Universe, Scene, and Physics management

## Next Steps

1. Complete backend implementation:
   - Finish API route handlers
   - Set up authentication
   - Create database migrations
   - Add validation and error handling

2. Complete frontend implementation:
   - Implement Redux thunks for API calls
   - Complete UI components for all CRUD operations
   - Implement modal system
   - Add form validation

3. Add styling:
   - Create a clean, professional CSS
   - Ensure responsive design
   - Implement consistent UI elements

4. Testing:
   - Create curl tests for API endpoints
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Verify frontend-backend integration

## Features Implemented

1. **Universe Management**
   - Create, Read, Update, Delete universes
   - List all universes
   - View universe details

2. **Scene Management**
   - Create, Read, Update, Delete scenes within a universe
   - List all scenes
   - View scene details

3. **Physics Objects Management**
   - Create, Read, Update, Delete physics objects
   - Associate physics objects with scenes
   - Configure physics object properties

4. **Physics Parameters Management**
   - Create, Read, Update, Delete physics parameters
   - Apply parameters to physics objects
   - Adjust parameter values

All features have a complete modal system for CRUD operations and a clean, professional UI.
## Completed Tasks
- Created clean three-directory structure (root, backend, frontend)
- Set up backend models for Universe, Scene, PhysicsObject, and PhysicsParameter
- Created frontend structure with React components and Redux store
## Next Steps
1. Complete backend API routes for all CRUD operations
2. Implement Redux slices and thunks for API communication
3. Complete React components for all four features (Universe, Scene, PhysicsObjects, PhysicsParameters)
4. Implement modal system for all CRUD operations
5. Apply professional CSS styling to all components
6. Test all CRUD operations with curl commands
## Features to Implement

   - Set up Redux store structure
   - Created basic layout components
## Remaining Tasks
1. Complete the frontend feature components for:
   - Universe management
   - Scene management
   - Physics Objects management
   - Physics Parameters management
2. Implement Redux thunks for API communication
3. Apply professional CSS styling to all components
