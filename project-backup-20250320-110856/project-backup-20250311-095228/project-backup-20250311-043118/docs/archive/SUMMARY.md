   - Frontend: Login and registration forms, user profile modal

2. **Universe Management**

   - Backend: Complete CRUD operations for universes
   - Frontend: Universe list, detail, create, edit, and delete functionality with modal support

3. **Scene Management**

   - Backend: Complete CRUD operations for scenes, including scene reordering
   - Frontend: Scene management within universe detail view, create/edit/delete modals

4. **Physics Parameters**

   - Backend: Complete CRUD operations for physics parameters
   - Frontend: Physics parameters management with modal support

5. **Physics Objects**

   - Backend: Complete CRUD operations for physics objects
   - Frontend: Physics objects management with modal support

6. **Audio Generation**

   - Backend: Audio generation, retrieval, and management
   - Frontend: Music player and visualization components

7. **Visualization**
   - Backend: Visualization generation and management
   - Frontend: Visualization components

### Modal System Implementation

The modal system has been standardized to use a single Modal.jsx component. The following modals have been implemented:

1. Universe Create/Edit Modal
2. Scene Create/Edit Modal
3. Physics Parameters Modal
4. Physics Object Modal
5. User Profile Modal
6. Confirm Delete Modal
7. Music Generation Modal

## Recent Updates

### Modal System Enhancements

1. **API Route Integration**

   - Added support for all API endpoints to open corresponding modals
   - Implemented deep linking for all modal types
   - Updated modal route handler to support new API routes

2. **New Modal Types**

   - Added support for audio-related modals
   - Added support for visualization-related modals
   - Added support for physics constraint modals

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated README.md with modal system information
   - Created comprehensive testing checklist for all modals
   - Updated verification summary with current implementation status

## Next Steps

1. **Modal Component Implementation**

   - Implement the actual modal components for audio, visualization, and physics constraints
   - Connect these components to the modal registry

2. **Testing**

   - Test all API routes to ensure they open the correct modals
   - Verify that all modals function correctly
   - Test deep linking functionality

3. **Documentation**
   - Create user documentation for the modal system
   - Update API documentation to reflect the current implementation

## Technical Architecture

The application uses a modern web architecture:

- **Frontend**: React.js with Redux for state management
- **Backend**: Python with Flask, SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **API**: RESTful API with versioning (/api/v1/...)
- **Modal System**: Centralized modal registry with deep linking support
