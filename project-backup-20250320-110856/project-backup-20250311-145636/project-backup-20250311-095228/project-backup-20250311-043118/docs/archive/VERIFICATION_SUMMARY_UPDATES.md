- **Frontend**: Scene management within universe detail view, create/edit/delete modals
- **Status**: ✅ Fully implemented

### 4. Physics Parameters

- **Backend**: Complete CRUD operations for physics parameters
- **Frontend**: Physics parameters management with modal support

## Modal System Implementation

The modal system has been standardized to use a single Modal.jsx component. The following modals have been implemented:

1. Universe Create/Edit Modal
2. Scene Create/Edit Modal
3. Physics Parameters Modal
4. Physics Object Modal
5. User Profile Modal
6. Confirm Delete Modal
7. Music Generation Modal

## Changes Made to Fix Verification Script Issues

### 1. Scene Order Parameter Handling

The verification script was expecting an `order` parameter for scenes, but the backend model used `scene_order`. We made the following changes:

- Updated the `create_scene` function in `backend/app/api/routes/scenes.py` to map the 'order' parameter to 'scene_order' if it exists in the input data:

  ```python
  if 'order' in data:
      data['scene_order'] = data.pop('order')
  ```

- Updated the `update_scene` function in `backend/app/api/routes/scenes.py` with the same mapping logic.

- Modified the `Scene.to_dict()` method in `backend/app/models/universe/scene.py` to include both 'order' and 'scene_order' in the output dictionary, with 'order' being a copy of 'scene_order':
  ```python
  "scene_order": self.scene_order,
  "order": self.scene_order,  # Adding order field as an alias for scene_order
  ```

### 2. Fixed Scene Reordering

- Fixed the `reorder_scenes` method in `SceneRepository` to use `scene_order` instead of `order` when updating the scene order:
  ```python
  scene.scene_order = i  # Changed from scene.order = i
  ```

### 3. Added User Profile Routes

- Added additional route aliases for user profile to match what the verification script expects:

  ```python
  @users_bp.route('/profile', methods=['GET'])
  @jwt_required()
  def get_user_profile():
      """
      Get the current user's profile (alias for get_me endpoint).
      """
      return get_me()

  @users_bp.route('/profile', methods=['PUT'])
  @jwt_required()
  def update_user_profile():
      """
      Update the current user's profile (alias for update_me endpoint).
      """
      return update_me()
  ```

### 4. Added Physics Parameters Validation Route

- Added a new route for validating physics parameters without saving them, matching what the verification script expects:
  ```python
  @physics_parameters_bp.route('/validate-parameters', methods=['POST'])
  @jwt_required()
  def validate_physics_parameters():
      """Validate physics parameters without saving - alias for validate endpoint."""
      return validate_parameters()
  ```

## Verification Results

- All tests now pass in mock mode, confirming that our API routes match what the verification script expects.
- When running against the actual API, connection errors were encountered, suggesting the API server was not running or not accessible.

## Next Steps

1. Start the API server to run the verification script against the actual API.
2. Ensure all database migrations are applied.
3. Check for any additional endpoint discrepancies that might appear when testing against the real API.
