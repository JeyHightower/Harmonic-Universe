# Integrating React Fixes with Flask

This document explains how to integrate the React.createContext fixes with your Flask application.

## 1. Import and Initialize the Patching Middleware

In your Flask application's main file (e.g., `app.py` or wherever you create your Flask app), add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask
import flask_react_patch  # Import our custom middleware

app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize the React patching middleware
flask_react_patch.init_app(app)

# Rest of your Flask app setup...
```

## 2. Update Your HTML Templates

If you're using Flask templates to serve your React app, make sure to include the React polyfill in your base template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- Add the React polyfill first -->
    {% if react_polyfill %}
    <script src="{{ react_polyfill_url }}"></script>
    {% endif %}

    <!-- Other head content -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## 3. Testing Your Setup

To test that everything is working correctly:

1. Check that the React polyfill script is being loaded in your HTML
2. Verify that Ant Icons components render correctly
3. Check the browser console for any React-related errors

## 4. Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the Flask logs for any errors in the middleware
2. Make sure the static files are being served correctly
3. Verify that the polyfill scripts were copied to the static directory
4. Try adding more verbose logging to the Flask middleware
