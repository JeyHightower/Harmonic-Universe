# Authentication Fix Guide for Harmonic Universe

## Problem

The 401 Unauthorized errors affecting CRUD operations for Universe, Scene, Character, and Notes features are caused by the following issues:

1. **Missing User Accounts**: The database lacked proper user accounts needed for authentication.
2. **Inconsistent JWT Secret Key**: The JWT secret key was not consistently configured across server restarts.
3. **Lack of Environment Configuration**: A proper .env file was missing for backend configuration.

## Solution

The following steps were taken to fix the issues:

### 1. Created Test Users

We created two test users in the database:

- `testuser` (test@example.com)
- `jey` (jey@example.io)

Both users have password: `password123`

### 2. Fixed Environment Configuration

Created a `.env` file in the backend directory with consistent configuration:

```
# Environment Configuration
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=1

# Secret Keys
SECRET_KEY=dev-secret-key-change-in-production
JWT_SECRET_KEY=dev-jwt-secret-key

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/harmonic_universe

# CORS Settings
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:5001
CORS_SUPPORTS_CREDENTIALS=true
```

### 3. Authentication Testing

A test page was created to verify the functionality:

- Located at: http://localhost:5001/static/test-login.html
- This page allows testing:
  - Login with created test accounts
  - Creating new universes
  - Retrieving universes

## Verifying the Fix

1. **Login** with one of the test users:

   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"jey@example.io", "password":"password123"}' http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login
   ```

2. **Use the token** from the response to create a universe:

   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -d '{"name":"Test Universe", "description":"Test description", "is_public":true}' http://localhost:5001/api/auth/universes
   ```

3. Or simply visit the test page: http://localhost:5001/static/test-login.html

## Ensuring Consistency Across Features

The fix applies to all CRUD operations for Universe, Scene, Character, and Notes features because:

1. All API routes use the same JWT authentication middleware (`@jwt_required()`)
2. The user authentication token is now properly validated
3. The database models use consistent integer primary keys (no UUID vs ID mismatch)

## Frontend Integration

For the frontend to properly authenticate:

1. Make sure the login works correctly
2. Store the token in localStorage under the `token` key
3. Include the token in all API requests with the header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
4. Handle 401 responses by redirecting to login

The frontend already has mechanisms for this, but they were failing due to the backend configuration issues.

## Going Forward

For future development:

1. Never delete the .env file
2. Use proper user accounts for testing
3. Check JWT token validation when experiencing 401 errors
4. Ensure CORS settings include all necessary frontend origins
