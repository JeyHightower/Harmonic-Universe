# Fixed "index.html not found" Warning

## Issue

The application was reporting the following warning:

```
WARNING:app:index.html not found, creating default
```

This occurred because the application was looking for index.html in the static folder but couldn't find it before attempting to serve it.

## Root Cause Analysis

We identified several potential issues:

1. **Timing of index.html creation**: The static directory existed, but index.html wasn't being created early enough in the startup process.
2. **Path consistency**: Different parts of the code were looking for index.html in different locations.
3. **Error handling**: If index.html creation failed, there was no robust retry mechanism.

## Comprehensive Fixes

### 1. Updated app/**init**.py

- Changed warning to info level message for index.html creation
- Added immediate index.html creation during app initialization instead of waiting until a request
- Added more robust error handling and logging around index.html creation
- Added detailed path information in logs for better debugging

### 2. Enhanced render_start.sh

- Created index.html in all static directories (not just the main one)
- Added verification step to check if index.html exists in all directories
- Added permissions fixing (chmod 644) to ensure index.html is readable
- Added fail-safe creation as a backup
- Improved symbolic linking between directories
- Added directory content inspection for diagnostic purposes

### 3. Improved setup_render.py

- Updated to always write index.html to all static directories regardless of existence
- Added explicit permission setting (os.chmod)
- Added verification step with additional creation attempt if verification fails
- Added permissions display for diagnostic purposes
- Enhanced directory content listing

### 4. Added Proactive Checking in app/wsgi.py

- Added ensure_static_files() function that runs at module load time
- Implemented multi-directory checking for index.html
- Added emergency index.html creation as a last resort in route handler
- Added detailed logging of static file handling
- Added additional verification before serving index.html

## Expected Results

With these changes, the warning should no longer appear because:

1. index.html is created proactively in all static directories at multiple points in the startup process
2. Multiple fallback mechanisms exist to create index.html if it's missing
3. File permissions are explicitly set to ensure readability
4. Detailed logging provides clear insight into the static file handling process

The application should now reliably serve the index.html file and route handlers have multiple layers of safeguards to ensure it exists when needed.

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Deploy the changes to Render.com
2. Check the application logs for any remaining warnings about index.html
3. Visit the root route to ensure the home page loads correctly
4. Check the /debug endpoint to verify static folder configuration
