# Server Issues Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Table Definition Error**: The `PhysicsParameters` model was being defined twice, causing SQLAlchemy errors.

   - Solution: Added `__table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True}` to the model definition.

2. **Blueprint Import Error**: The `music_bp` blueprint was missing from the routes/**init**.py file.

   - Solution: Added the import and export of `music_bp` in the routes/**init**.py file.

3. **User Registration API Error**: The registration endpoint returns a 400 error with a generic "Registration failed" message.
   - Direct database registration works fine, but the API endpoint fails.
   - The error is likely occurring in the exception handling block of the register function.

## Solutions Implemented

1. Fixed the `PhysicsParameters` model by adding `__table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True}`.
2. Updated the routes/**init**.py file to properly import and export all blueprints.
3. Enhanced error logging in the auth.py register function to provide more detailed information about registration failures.

## Remaining Issues

1. **User Registration API**: The API endpoint still returns a 400 error. This could be due to:

   - An exception being thrown in the register function that's not being properly logged.
   - A validation error in the request data that's not being properly reported.
   - A database connection issue specific to the API endpoint.

2. **Mock Mode Tests**: Several tests fail in mock mode, indicating that the mock responses may not be properly configured.

## Next Steps

1. Add more detailed logging to the register function to identify the exact cause of the error.
2. Check the database connection in the context of the API endpoint.
3. Verify that the request data is being properly parsed and validated.
4. Update the mock responses to match the expected API responses.

## Testing Results

- Direct database operations work fine (user creation, queries, etc.).
- API endpoints return errors, particularly for user registration.
- Mock mode tests show that many endpoints are not properly configured in the mock responses.
