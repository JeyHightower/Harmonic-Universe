   - characters_consolidated
   - scenes_consolidated
   - universe_consolidated

2. Created documentation for each consolidated directory

3. Added detailed cleanup plan in src/cleanup_completion_2.md

Progress update (April 8, 2025):

1. Updated key imports to use consolidated components:

   - Updated scene forms to use CharacterSelector from characters_consolidated
   - Updated routes to use scene components from scenes_consolidated
   - Updated universe-related files to use scene and universe components from consolidated directories
