# Scene Feature Refactoring

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring of the Scene feature to align with the standardized feature structure defined in STANDARD-STRUCTURE.md.

## Changes Made
1. The Scene feature already had the correct directory structure:
   - `frontend/src/components/features/scene/components/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/scene/modals/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/scene/pages/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/scene/styles/`

2. The component exports in index.js already follow the standardized pattern, with components being exported from their specific directories.

3. Updated import paths in the following files:
   - Updated `frontend/src/App.jsx` to import the SceneDetail component from its new location in the scene feature directory

## Directory Structure
The Scene feature follows this structure:

```
scene/
├── README.md
├── index.js               # Exports all scene components
├── components/
│   ├── SceneCard.jsx
│   ├── SceneCardSimple.jsx
│   ├── ScenesExample.jsx
│   ├── SceneViewer.jsx
│   └── ScenesList.jsx
├── modals/
│   ├── SceneDeleteConfirmation.jsx
│   └── SceneModal.jsx
├── pages/
│   ├── SceneForm.jsx
│   ├── SceneList.jsx
│   ├── SceneDetail.jsx
│   └── SceneEditPage.jsx
└── styles/
```

## Usage Example
The components can be imported using the following pattern:

```jsx
import { SceneCard, ScenesList, SceneDetail } from '../components/features/scene';
```

## Verification
The refactoring was verified by checking that the imports were updated correctly and that the application builds without errors related to the scene feature.

## Next Steps
- Continue refactoring other features to follow the same pattern if needed
