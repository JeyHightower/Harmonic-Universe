# JWT Authentication Fix

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the JWT authentication issues in the Harmonic Universe application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **JWT Signature Verification Failed**
   - The application was sending refresh token instead of the actual token to the `/auth/refresh` endpoint, causing signature verification failures
   - The backend expects `token` parameter, but the frontend was sending `refreshToken` parameter

2. **Missing Refresh Mechanism**
   - The application was attempting to use a refresh token, but was not properly storing or handling it
   - The backend doesn't actually have a separate refresh token implementation

3. **Token Cleanup Issues**
   - When authentication failed, not all token-related values were properly cleaned up

## Changes Made

### Frontend Services

1. **auth.service.mjs**
   - Updated `refreshToken` function to use the main token for refresh requests
   - Simplified token storage to only use the main token
   - Fixed error handling in token refresh

2. **http-client.mjs**
   - Updated token refresh mechanism to properly handle authentication errors
   - Improved retry logic to update authorization headers correctly when retrying with a new token
   - Enhanced error handling for authentication failures

3. **authSlice.mjs**
   - Simplified token handling to focus on the main token
   - Enhanced token validation in the `checkAuthState` thunk
   - Improved error handling and logging for authentication state

4. **App.jsx**
   - Added proper token validation on application initialization
   - Improved handling of token verification failures
   - Enhanced error handling and user redirection on auth errors

5. **Dashboard.jsx**
   - Improved authentication error handling
   - Better user experience when auth errors occur
   - Fixed redirect flow after token failures

### Environment and Backend

The JWT secret key (`harmonic-universe-jwt-secret-key`) is defined in the backend `.env` file and should be consistent between token generation and verification. 

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix:

1. Clear localStorage in your browser
2. Log in with demo credentials
3. Verify that API requests are successful
4. Check the network tab for successful API calls

If authentication issues persist, please check:
1. JWT secret key configuration in backend
2. Browser console for any token-related errors
3. Network tab for failed API requests

## Implementation Details

The key realization was that the Harmonic Universe backend uses a simple JWT authentication system without separate refresh tokens. The frontend was incorrectly trying to use a two-token system. We've simplified this to match the backend's expectations.
