# Consolidation Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### Component Consolidation

- ✅ Created consolidated character components directory
- ✅ Created consolidated scene components directory
- ✅ Created consolidated universe components directory
- ✅ Deleted original component directories after updating imports:
  - ✅ `src/components/character`
  - ✅ `src/components/characters`
  - ✅ `src/components/consolidated`
  - ✅ `src/components/scenes`
  - ✅ `src/components/universe`
- ✅ Renamed consolidated directories to their final names:
  - ✅ `characters_consolidated` → `characters`
  - ✅ `scenes_consolidated` → `scenes`
  - ✅ `universe_consolidated` → `universe`

### Import Updates

- ✅ Updated imports in all files to use the consolidated components:
  - ✅ Updated SceneForm.jsx to use CharacterSelector from characters directory
  - ✅ Updated routes/index.jsx to use scene components from scenes directory
  - ✅ Updated universe-related files to use scene components from scenes directory
  - ✅ Updated universe-related files to use components from universe directory
  - ✅ Updated README files with correct import paths

### Component Deduplication

- ✅ Created consolidated universe modal components:
  - ✅ `UniverseModalFinal.jsx` - Consolidates `CreateUniverseModal.jsx`, `UniverseCreateModal.jsx`, and `UniverseFormModal.jsx`
  - ✅ `UniverseDeleteModalFinal.jsx` - Consolidates `DeleteUniverseModal.jsx` and `UniverseDeleteModal.jsx`
- ✅ Updated imports to use these consolidated components:
  - ✅ Updated Dashboard.jsx to use UniverseModalFinal
  - ✅ Updated UniverseDetail.jsx files to use UniverseModalFinal and UniverseDeleteModalFinal

## Next Steps

1. Test application to ensure all components work correctly with the new imports
2. Document the new component structure in the project's main README
3. Consider further refactoring to eliminate any remaining duplicate code or functionality
