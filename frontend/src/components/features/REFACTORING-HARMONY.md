# Harmony Feature Refactoring

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring of the Harmony feature to align with the standardized feature structure defined in STANDARD-STRUCTURE.md.

## Changes Made
1. Created subdirectories for components, modals, and styles:
   - `frontend/src/components/features/harmony/components/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/harmony/modals/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/harmony/styles/`

2. Moved component files to their appropriate directories:
   - Moved `HarmonyPanel.jsx` to `components/` directory
   - Moved `HarmonyParametersModal.jsx` to `modals/` directory
   - CSS files were already in the `styles/` directory

3. Updated import paths in the following files:
   - Updated `frontend/src/components/features/harmony/index.js` to export components from their new locations
   - Updated `frontend/src/components/index.js` to import harmony components from their new locations
   - Updated `frontend/src/components/componentUtils/ModalUtils.jsx` to import HarmonyParametersModal from its new location

## Directory Structure
The Harmony feature now follows this structure:

```
harmony/
├── README.md
├── index.js               # Exports all harmony components
├── components/
│   └── HarmonyPanel.jsx   # Main panel component
├── modals/
│   └── HarmonyParametersModal.jsx  # Modal for editing parameters
└── styles/
    ├── Universe.css                # Shared styles (used by HarmonyPanel)
    └── HarmonyParametersModal.css  # Specific styles for the modal
```

## Usage Example
The components can be imported using the following pattern:

```jsx
import { HarmonyPanel, HarmonyParametersModal } from '../components/features/harmony';
```

## Verification
The refactoring was verified by checking that the imports were updated correctly and that the application builds without errors related to the harmony feature.

## Next Steps
- Consider updating the README.md file for the harmony feature to reflect the new structure
- Continue refactoring other features to follow the same pattern if needed
