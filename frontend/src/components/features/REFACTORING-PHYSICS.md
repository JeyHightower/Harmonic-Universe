# Physics Feature Refactoring

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring of the Physics feature to align with the standardized feature structure defined in STANDARD-STRUCTURE.md.

## Changes Made
1. The Physics feature already had the correct directory structure:
   - `frontend/src/components/features/physics/components/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/physics/modals/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/physics/pages/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/physics/styles/`

2. Updated import paths in the following files:
   - Updated `frontend/src/components/index.js` to import physics components from their specific directories

## Directory Structure
The Physics feature follows this structure:

```
physics/
├── README.md
├── index.js               # Exports all physics components
├── components/
│   ├── PhysicsPanel.jsx
│   ├── PhysicsObjectsManager.jsx
│   ├── PhysicsObjectsList.jsx
│   ├── PhysicsParametersManager.jsx
│   └── PhysicsObjectForm.jsx
├── modals/
│   ├── PhysicsObjectModal.jsx
│   ├── PhysicsSettingsModal.jsx
│   ├── PhysicsConstraintModal.jsx
│   └── PhysicsParametersModal.jsx
├── pages/
│   ├── PhysicsPage.jsx
│   └── PhysicsEditor.jsx
└── styles/
```

## Usage Example
The components can be imported using the following pattern:

```jsx
import { PhysicsPanel, PhysicsEditor } from '../components/features/physics';
```

## Verification
The refactoring was verified by checking that the imports were updated correctly and that the application builds without errors related to the physics feature.

## Next Steps
- Continue refactoring other features to follow the same pattern if needed
