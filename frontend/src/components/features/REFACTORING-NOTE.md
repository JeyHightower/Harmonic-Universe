# Note Feature Refactoring

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring of the Note feature to align with the standardized feature structure defined in STANDARD-STRUCTURE.md.

## Changes Made
1. The Note feature already had the correct directory structure:
   - `frontend/src/components/features/note/components/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/note/modals/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/note/pages/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/note/styles/`

2. The component exports in index.js already follow the standardized pattern, with components being exported from their specific directories.

3. Updated import paths in the following files:
   - Updated `frontend/src/components/index.js` to import lazy-loaded note components from their specific directories

## Directory Structure
The Note feature follows this structure:

```
note/
├── README.md
├── index.js               # Exports all note components
├── components/
│   ├── NoteList.jsx
│   └── NoteCard.jsx
├── modals/
│   └── NoteFormModal.jsx
├── pages/
│   ├── NoteForm.jsx
│   └── NoteDetail.jsx
└── styles/
```

## Usage Example
The components can be imported using the following pattern:

```jsx
import { NoteList, NoteCard, NoteForm } from '../components/features/note';
```

## Verification
The refactoring was verified by checking that the imports were updated correctly and that the application builds without errors related to the note feature.

## Next Steps
- Continue refactoring other features to follow the same pattern if needed
