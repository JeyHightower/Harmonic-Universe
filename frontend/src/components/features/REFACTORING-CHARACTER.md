# Character Feature Refactoring

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring of the Character feature to align with the standardized feature structure defined in STANDARD-STRUCTURE.md.

## Changes Made
1. The Character feature already had the correct directory structure:
   - `frontend/src/components/features/character/components/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/character/modals/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/character/pages/`
   - `frontend/src/components/features/character/styles/`

2. The component exports in index.js already follow the standardized pattern, with components being exported from their specific directories.

3. The imports in the main components/index.js file already follow the correct pattern, importing from the character feature directory.

## Directory Structure
The Character feature follows this structure:

```
character/
├── README.md
├── index.js               # Exports all character components
├── components/
│   ├── CharacterCard.jsx
│   ├── CharacterList.jsx
│   └── CharacterSelector.jsx
├── modals/
│   └── CharacterModal.jsx
├── pages/
│   ├── CharacterForm.jsx
│   ├── CharacterManagement.jsx
│   └── CharacterDetail.jsx
└── styles/
```

## Usage Example
The components can be imported using the following pattern:

```jsx
import { CharacterCard, CharacterList, CharacterForm } from '../components/features/character';
```

## Verification
The feature was already properly structured according to the standardized pattern, so no changes were needed.

## Next Steps
- Continue refactoring other features to follow the same pattern if needed
