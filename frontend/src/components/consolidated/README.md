# Harmonic Universe Frontend Consolidation

This directory contains consolidated components and utilities that are meant to replace duplicate implementations found throughout the codebase.

## Consolidation Plan

### 1. Component Consolidation

- **SceneCard**: Consolidated from multiple implementations (components/scene/SceneCard.jsx, components/scenes/SceneCard.jsx, features/SceneCard.jsx) ✅
- **SceneDetail**: Consolidated from multiple implementations (components/scene/SceneDetail.jsx, components/scenes/SceneDetail.jsx, features/SceneDetail.jsx) ✅
- **UniverseDetail**: Keep the implementation in features/UniverseDetail.jsx and update all imports ✅
- **PhysicsPanel**: Keep the implementation in components/physics/PhysicsPanel.jsx ✅
- **HarmonyPanel**: Keep the implementation in components/harmony/HarmonyPanel.jsx ✅

### 2. Thunks Consolidation

- Standardized on plural naming (scenesThunks.js, universesThunks.js)
- Consolidated duplicate functionality between sceneThunks.js and scenesThunks.js
- Added aliases for backward compatibility

### 3. Import Standardization

- Update all imports to reference consolidated files
- Use consistent relative paths

## Implementation Steps

1. Create consolidated components and thunks ✅
2. Update import paths in all files ✅
3. Remove duplicate files ✅
4. Test thoroughly ⏳

## Migration Strategy

For each component migration:

1. Copy files to this directory ✅
2. Update imports in a single file at a time ✅
3. Test after each set of changes ⏳
4. Remove duplicates once all imports are updated ✅

## Validation

After consolidation, run the full test suite and manually verify key functionality:

- Scene creation, editing, and deletion
- Universe management
- Navigation between screens
