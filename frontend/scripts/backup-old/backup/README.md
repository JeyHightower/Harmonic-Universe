# Backup of Redundant Scripts

This directory contains backup copies of scripts that have been organized into more maintainable core utility files. These files are kept as reference but are no longer actively used in the codebase.

## Core Replacements

The original scripts in this directory have been replaced by three core scripts:

1. `frontend/scripts/core/build.mjs` - Replaces various build scripts
2. `frontend/scripts/core/react.mjs` - Replaces React-related utilities
3. `frontend/scripts/core/ant-icons.mjs` - Replaces Ant Icons utilities

## Directory Structure

- `build/` - Backup of build-related scripts
- `react/` - Backup of React-related scripts
- `providers/` - Backup of provider-related scripts
- `ant-icons/` - Backup of Ant Icons-related scripts

## Migration Date

These scripts were organized and backed up on April 13, 2023.
