# MVP Features for Harmonic Universe

This document outlines the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** features for the capstone project, divided into core requirements and bonus additions.

---

## **Core MVP Features**

### **1. Universe CRUD**

- Users can:
  - Create new universes with custom names and descriptions.
  - View a list of all their saved universes.
  - Update universes to tweak physical and musical settings.
  - Delete universes they no longer need.

---

### **2. Physics Parameters CRUD**

- Users can:
  - Add new parameters that define physics for a universe (e.g., gravity, friction).
  - Retrieve and view parameters to analyze their effects.
  - Edit existing parameters to test new world dynamics.

---

### **3. Music Integration**

- Users can:
  - Tune harmony, tempo, and pitch based on universe physics.
  - Save these settings persistently.
  - Generate dynamic music tied to physics rules dynamically.

---

## **Bonus Features**

### **1. Storyboards**

- Add plot points or narrative elements tied to universes.
- Associate harmony or physics conditions with storytelling events (e.g., pivotal moments in physics shifts).

### **2. Dynamic Visualizations**

- Render real-time physics simulations using libraries like **p5.js** or **D3.js** to give users visual feedback.

---

## **Planned Future Features**

- AI-powered suggestions for physics or harmony configurations.
- Export universes as JSON, MIDI, or simulation videos.
- Real-time multiplayer universe collaboration.
