==== Step 2: Consolidating static files ====
Consolidating React fix files...
Created symlink for: hook-fix.js
Created symlink for: hook-js-patcher.js
Created symlink for: react-context-fix.js
Created symlink for: react-fix-loader.js
Created symlink for: react-hook-fix.js
Created symlink for: vendor-react-BasmCCun.js
Created symlink for: vendor-react-DJ7Kff-Q.js
Created symlink for: vendor-react.js
Backed up: ./static/index.html
Using frontend/dist/index.html as the canonical version
Created redirecting index.html for app/static
==== Step 3: Cleaning up JavaScript files ====
Backed up: static/index-D8-aAJoQ.js
Backing up duplicate JS file: static/index-D8-aAJoQ.js (will be removed)
Backed up: static/Layout-CaNh0xx_.js
Backing up duplicate JS file: static/Layout-CaNh0xx_.js (will be removed)
Backed up: static/Dashboard-3e6RHIoY.js
Backing up duplicate JS file: static/Dashboard-3e6RHIoY.js (will be removed)
Backed up: static/Home-BrEEk1Rb.js
Backing up duplicate JS file: static/Home-BrEEk1Rb.js (will be removed)
Kept latest index file: static/index-D8-aAJoQ.js
Kept latest Layout file: static/Layout-CaNh0xx_.js
Kept latest Dashboard file: static/Dashboard-3e6RHIoY.js
Kept latest Home file: static/Home-BrEEk1Rb.js
Backed up: ./static/index.html
Updated index.html to use consolidated JS files
==== Step 4: Updating Python codebase references ====
Backed up: ./app.py
Updated static folder path in app.py
Backed up: ./app/__init__.py
Verified static folder path in app/__init__.py
==== Step 5: Updating frontend configuration ====
==== Cleanup Complete! ====
Backup of original files stored in: ./backups/20250310_110135
All major code duplications have been consolidated
Next steps: 
1. Verify the application runs correctly with the consolidated files
2. Remove unnecessary backup files once verified
3. Update documentation to reflect the new directory structure

==== Step 2: Consolidating static files ====
Consolidating React fix files...
Backed up: ./static/index.html
Using frontend/public/index.html as the canonical version
Created redirecting index.html for app/static
==== Step 3: Cleaning up JavaScript files ====
Backed up: static/index-D8-aAJoQ.js
Backing up duplicate JS file: static/index-D8-aAJoQ.js (will be removed)
Backed up: static/Layout-CaNh0xx_.js
Backing up duplicate JS file: static/Layout-CaNh0xx_.js (will be removed)
Backed up: static/Dashboard-3e6RHIoY.js
Backing up duplicate JS file: static/Dashboard-3e6RHIoY.js (will be removed)
Backed up: static/Home-BrEEk1Rb.js
Backing up duplicate JS file: static/Home-BrEEk1Rb.js (will be removed)
Kept latest index file: static/index-D8-aAJoQ.js
Kept latest Layout file: static/Layout-CaNh0xx_.js
Kept latest Dashboard file: static/Dashboard-3e6RHIoY.js
Kept latest Home file: static/Home-BrEEk1Rb.js
Backed up: ./static/index.html
Updated index.html to use consolidated JS files
==== Step 4: Updating Python codebase references ====
Backed up: ./app.py
Updated static folder path in app.py
Backed up: ./app/__init__.py
Verified static folder path in app/__init__.py
==== Step 5: Updating frontend configuration ====
==== Cleanup Complete! ====
Backup of original files stored in: ./backups/20250310_110849
All major code duplications have been consolidated
Next steps: 
1. Verify the application runs correctly with the consolidated files
2. Remove unnecessary backup files once verified
3. Update documentation to reflect the new directory structure
