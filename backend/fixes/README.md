# Deployment Fixes Directory

This directory contains files used for fixing deployment issues on Render.com.
These files are referenced by deployment scripts like render-build.sh and render-start.sh.

**Note:** These files are not directly imported by the main application but are used
during the deployment process. Do not delete these files unless you are certain they
are no longer needed by any deployment scripts.
