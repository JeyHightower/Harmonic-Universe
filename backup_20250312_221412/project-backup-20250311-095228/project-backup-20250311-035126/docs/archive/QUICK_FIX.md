# Quick Solution Summary

To fix the 'relation already exists' error during deployment:

1. Add the three script files to your repository: fix_migrations.py, skip_migrations.py, and render_build_safe.sh
2. Update render.yaml to use render_build_safe.sh
3. Make the files executable with chmod +x
4. Deploy again

This solution works by telling the migration system about your existing database tables without trying to recreate them.
