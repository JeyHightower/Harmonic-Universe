## Refactoring Suggestions
### Component Refactoring
1. Create shared base components for similar UI patterns
2. Extract common logic into custom hooks
3. Use composition over inheritance for component variations
4. Create higher-order components for shared functionality

### Service Refactoring
1. Create base service classes/interfaces
2. Extract common API handling logic
3. Use dependency injection for service dependencies
4. Create service factories for similar service patterns

### Utility Function Refactoring
1. Create unified utility modules
2. Use function composition for complex utilities
3. Create type-safe utility functions
4. Extract common patterns into shared helpers

### Test Refactoring
1. Create shared test fixtures
2. Use test factories for common test data
3. Extract common test setup logic
4. Create test utilities for repeated assertions
## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize the identified duplicates
2. Create shared abstractions for common patterns
3. Implement suggested refactoring strategies
4. Update documentation to reflect new patterns
5. Add tests for new shared components/utilities
