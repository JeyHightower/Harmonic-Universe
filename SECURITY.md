# Repository Security Policy

## Branch Structure
- `main`: Primary protected branch
- `features`: Development branch for new features
All changes must go through pull requests to main branch.

## Branch Protection Rules
- Main branch is protected and requires pull request reviews
- Direct pushes to main branch are disabled
- Branch protection rules are enforced for all administrators
- Linear history is required

## Security Measures
1. Pre-commit Hooks
   - Checks for sensitive data patterns
   - Prevents large file commits (>10MB)
   - Blocks binary file commits
   - Validates commit messages

2. Git Configuration
   - Default branch: main
   - Push behavior: simple with tags
   - Force push protection enabled
   - File mode tracking enabled
   - Line ending normalization configured
   - Case sensitivity enforced
   - (GPG commit signing temporarily disabled)

3. Repository Settings
   - Dependabot alerts enabled
   - Security scanning enabled
   - Push protection enabled
   - Two-factor authentication required

4. Access Control
   - Limited collaborator access
   - Team-based permissions
   - Regular access review
   - Audit logging enabled

## Security Best Practices
1. Never commit sensitive data
2. Use environment variables for secrets
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Regular security audits
5. Follow the principle of least privilege

## Emergency Procedures
1. If compromised:
   - Immediately revoke access tokens
   - Reset all passwords
   - Review recent commits
   - Contact repository administrators

## Regular Maintenance
1. Weekly:
   - Review security alerts
   - Update dependencies
   - Check access logs

2. Monthly:
   - Full security audit
   - Access review
   - Policy review

## Branch Management
1. All feature development must be done in feature branches
2. Branch naming convention: `feature/feature-name`
3. Branches must be deleted after successful merge
4. Force pushing to protected branches is disabled

## Contact
For security concerns, contact the repository administrators.

## Future Security Enhancements
1. GPG Signing Setup (Pending)
   - Install GPG tools
