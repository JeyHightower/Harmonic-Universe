# Frontend Directory Structure Fix

## Problem

The project had a nested directory structure:

```
/frontend/frontend/
```

This caused confusion with:

- Path resolution in imports
- Build and development scripts
- Overall project organization

## Solution

### 1. Created a Merge Script

Created a Node.js script (`scripts/merge_nested_frontend.js`) that:

- Identified files in the nested structure
- Copied them to the correct locations in the parent structure
- Preserved existing files
- Provided instructions for cleanup

### 2. Merged the Directories

- Ran the merge script to copy files from `frontend/frontend/src` to `frontend/src`
- Verified that all necessary directories and files were copied correctly
- Key directories that were merged included:
  - `features/audio`
  - `features/physicsConstraints`
  - `features/visualization`

### 3. Removed the Nested Directory

After verifying that all files were correctly merged, we removed the now-redundant nested directory structure.

### 4. Updated Documentation

- Added documentation about the merge script to the scripts README
- Added a new npm script `merge-nested` to package.json for any future similar issues

## Verification

- Started the development server to verify the application still works correctly
- Checked all required files are in the correct locations
- The directory structure is now clean and logical

## Benefits

- Simplified imports (no more confusing nested paths)
- Clearer project structure
- Easier maintenance
- Consistent with standard React project organization

## Next Steps

- Update any documentation that might reference the old structure
- Review imports in source files that might still reference the nested structure
- Commit these changes to version control
